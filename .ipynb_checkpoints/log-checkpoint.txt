Question: how to run the laser?

Operator: 

To run the laser, the user must first purge the system with nitrogen or clean, dry air for a minimum of two hours. The user must then mount the laser system with the RF power module readily accessible through service access panels in the OEM's system. The user must also provide easy access to electrical connections, cooling connections, and the optics purge gas connection. Connections must ensure correct grounding for the system. As an added precaution, an additional safety ground may be configured using a direct connection to the DC return terminal at the laser. Under no circumstance should earth ground be connected to the DC supply return terminal. To connect the optics purge gas use clean polyethylene, polypropylene or Teflon tubing. A 1/4 inch outside diameter tube fitting is provided on the laser head for connecting the optics purge gas. The purge gas at this input must meet the requirements discussed earlier in this section. Finally, the user must connect the +48 VDC cable from the DC power supply to the +48 VDC marked connector on the rear panel, and connect the DC return cable from the DC power supply to the marked connector on the rear panel.

Question: make marketing pitch for this product

Operator: 
Image-guided cancer surgery is a revolutionary technology that can help surgeons accurately differentiate between normal and malignant tissue in real-time, enabling them to determine adequate tumor margins and improve patient survival. With the use of near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging, contrast agents such as indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue (MB) can be injected around a primary tumor to identify the sentinel lymph node (SLN), which can then be resected. In addition, NIRF imaging can be used to detect tumor margins and vital structures, such as the ureter or bile duct, and even nerves. The latest EMCCD camera series from Andor, such as the iXon Ultra 888, offers frame rates that are up to three times faster and quantitative calibration of signal in units of photons or electrons, either in real-time or post-processing. With the help of this revolutionary technology, surgeons can now perform image-guided cancer surgery with greater accuracy and precision, leading to improved patient outcomes.

Question: tell me about Snell's Law 

Operator: Snell's law, also known as Snell–Descartes law or the law of refraction, is a formula used to describe the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction when referring to light or other waves passing through a boundary between two different isotropic media. The law states that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is equivalent to the ratio of velocities in the two media, or equivalent to the reciprocal of the ratio of the indices of refraction of the two media. In other words, the incident ray, the refracted ray, and the normal to the interface of two media at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.

To set the focus, use the Focus Mirror Control in the software interface. Position the mouse cursor over the Focus Mirror Control and left-click. This will open the Focus Mirror Control dialog. Use the mouse button and move the cursor to adjust the focus. The displayed focus value changes to reflect the selected value. The focus drive will drive to the new value when the mouse button is released. Additionally, take care to avoid potential pinch points when adjusting the focus mirror and turret. In the event of an accident, switch off the unit at the main switch and extract the finger for the focus mirror, and loosen the central turret mounting screw and try and lift the turret by 2 mm to release the finger or object caught for the turret. Grating adjustment for yaw is corrected for in the software, using the offset adjustment. No manual adjustment is required. Screws are used for grating adjustment as shown in Figure 12.

Question: How to cool down lbo?

Operator: 

To cool down the LBO, the user should access the System Shutdown menu from the main menu and press the MENU SELECT pushbutton. The front panel will then display the status “system cooling down (xx%)”. This takes approximately 45 minutes to complete; progress update is displayed as a percentage value. If a fault occurs during the cooling down process, the CPU will close the shutter, set the laser diode current to zero, and display the Fault Status Screen. To clear the fault, the appropriate troubleshooting steps should be taken. The power supply keyswitch should be turned to the STANDBY position and the EXIT pushbutton pressed. Once the condition that caused the fault no longer exists, exit the Fault Status screen to clear the fault. Once the keyswitch is turned to the ON position, laser operation can resume. The shut-down can be aborted at any time by accessing the “system warm up” menu from the main menu.

Question: how to replace diffraction grating?

Operator: 

1. Visually inspect the GVD grating, and measure the laser power entering and exiting the GVD assembly to estimate the transmission efficiency as a baseline for comparison. 
2. If the damage is local to a small area of the grating (e.g. where the laser beams are reflected) then it may be possible to move the grating sideways by a few beam widths, and restore the performance. 
3. To remove or adjust the grating, loosen the two set screws from the rear of the grating holder, and slide the grating out sideways, using gloved hands. It may be necessary to rotate the grating holder slightly (against the return spring) in order to remove the grating completely. 
4. Being careful not to touch the grating front surface, slide in the new grating. It MUST be inserted in the correct orientation, with grating surface at the front surface, and with the serial number written at the top. If the grating is not inserted the correct way around, the laser transmission will be very poor. 
5. Replacing or sliding the grating will not have a large effect on the laser alignment, so only minor adjustments are expected, if any. Additionally

Question: How to change wavelength? 

Operator: 

To change the wavelength of the laser, an adjustable tuning element can be used to select the central wavelength that is amplified. The wavelength can also be restricted further by optical filters or other devices. Additionally, the cavity length can be regulated so the repetition rate always matches the modulator frequency. Spatial hole burning can also be used to allow two modes to operate simultaneously, which can help to increase the instantaneous power and thus the wavelength of the laser.

Question: 

Operator: In the past few years, the term “big data” has been used to describe the increasing amounts of data that organizations have to manage. Big data is a term used to describe large and complex datasets that are too large and complex for traditional data-processing application software to adequately deal with.

Big data is often characterized by the three “Vs” — volume, velocity, and variety. Volume refers to the amount of data, velocity to the speed at which the data is generated and collected, and variety to the range of data types and sources.

Big data can be used to improve decision-making and increase operational efficiency. Organizations can use big data to analyze customer behavior, optimize the supply chain, and identify new market opportunities. Big data can also be used to improve security, detect fraud, and improve customer service.

Organizations need to use the right tools and technologies to effectively manage and analyze big data. This includes software for data storage, data processing, data analysis, and visualization. Organizations also need to have skilled personnel to interpret the results and make decisions.

In addition to the tools and technologies needed to manage big data, organizations need to ensure that their data is secure and protected from unauthorized access. Security measures such as encryption and access control need to be implemented to ensure that data is not compromised.

Finally, it is important for organizations to have a strategy for managing big data. This includes identifying the data that needs to be collected, determining how the data will be stored, and deciding how the data will be analyzed and used. Organizations need to ensure that they have the right tools and technologies in place to effectively manage and analyze their data.

Question: how to calculate what temperature of cooling water should i use in depends on enviroment conditions? 

Operator: 

To calculate what temperature of cooling water should be used in different environmental conditions, the Dew Point graph can be used. The graph plots the relationship between relative humidity and Dew Point at varying ambient temperatures. This can be used to calculate the minimum temperature the cooling water should be set to in order to avoid condensation. In a relatively dry atmosphere of an air-conditioned lab, cooling water at 10ºC should not present any problems. However, in humid conditions (such as exist in some parts of the world) condensation may occur, resulting in damage to the head. In such conditions, warmer water (20ºC or even higher if it is very humid) should be used. If condensation is seen on the outside of the camera body, the system should be switched off and the camera wiped with a soft, dry cloth. A chiller or a re-circulator unit can be used to achieve maximum cooling performance with the camera system.

Question: 

Operator: The US-China trade war is far from over and the latest round of tariffs is scheduled to take effect on December 15th.

On Friday, President Donald Trump announced that the US will impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods starting December 15th. The tariff will apply to products that are not already subject to existing tariffs.

The announcement came after the two sides failed to reach an agreement at a meeting in Washington earlier this week.

The tariffs are expected to hit consumer products such as electronics, apparel, and footwear.

The US and China have been locked in a trade war for more than a year, with both sides imposing tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other’s goods.

The trade war has had a significant impact on both countries’ economies and has weighed on global markets.

The latest round of tariffs is expected to further dampen the prospects of a trade deal between the two countries and could further complicate global trade.

It remains to be seen how the two sides will respond to the latest tariffs and whether or not they will be able to reach a resolution.

Question: how to trigger a laser using the camera's internal pulse generator 

Operator: 

To trigger a laser using the camera's internal pulse generator, the user must first set the external trigger rate to not exceed 15 kHz. Then, the user must enable the Gate Step, Output A/B/C, and Waveforms Operation. The user must then select the Advanced: Burst/Fit Pulses per Exposure mode. This mode will generate several gate pulses within an exposure, with the gate delay applied incrementally for each successive exposure in the series. The user must then define the number of pulses per exposure, and any subsequent triggers that arrive during the exposure will be ignored. Additionally, the output of the image intensifier should be coupled to a sensor via a fibre-optic plate for low distortion and maximum throughput. The fibre-optics plate should be tapered to best match the image intensifier aperture size to the CCD size. Finally, the user must ARM the External Trigger, Fire the gate Monitor, and start the acquisition.

Question: why fiber has slow and fast axis? 

Operator: Fiber has slow and fast axes because of the way light travels through the fiber. The slow axis is the axis along which light travels slower than along the fast axis, due to the refractive index of the fiber core being different in the two directions. This difference in refractive index is caused by the asymmetric shape of the fiber core, which is usually elliptical. The slow axis is usually aligned with the longer axis of the fiber core, while the fast axis is aligned with the shorter axis. The slow and fast axes of the fiber determine the polarization of the light that is transmitted through the fiber.

Question: how to record perfect video ?

Operator: 

To record perfect video, make sure to keep the camera out of direct sunlight, turn the camera off when it is not being used, and set the file format to XAVC S. Additionally, make sure to leave the camera for some time with the power turned off if it stops recording due to a high temperature. Check the temperature of the camera regularly and make sure the movie file size does not reach approx. 2 GB during recording. Also, adjust the settings such as the focus, HDR, noise reduction, and movie file format to ensure the best quality video.

Question: Question: how to trigger laser using cameras internal signal generator?


Operator: Answer: To trigger a laser using a camera's internal signal generator, you will need to use a triggering circuit. This circuit will take the camera's signal and convert it into a signal that is suitable for the laser. Depending on the specific camera model, you may need to use a specific circuit for this purpose. The circuit should be designed to accept the signal from the camera, convert it to the necessary voltage and current, and then output the signal to the laser. It is important to ensure that the circuit is designed to work with the specific camera model in order to ensure that the laser is triggered properly.

Question: how can be this camera useful during ssurgeries?

Operator: 
The camera can be used to detect tumor margins, identify vital structures, and detect proteases in malignant tissue. It can also be used to identify hollow structures such as the ureter or bile duct and solid structures such as nerves. Additionally, it can be used for sentinel lymph node mapping, which involves the injection of contrast agents (fluorophores) that emit light in the NIR light spectrum (650 to 900 nm). This allows for improved penetration of photons in and out of tissue because absorption, light scattering and tissue autofluorescence are relatively low, thereby offering adequate contrast. The camera can also be used for wide-area imaging to enable the quantitative molecular phenotyping of freshly excised tissues during surgery.

Operator: 

To show the exchange rate of USD/EUR in an Excel sheet, you can use the CURRENCY function. This function takes two parameters: the currency you are converting from and the currency you are converting to. For example, to show the exchange rate of USD/EUR, you would use the formula =CURRENCY("USD","EUR"). This will return the exchange rate of USD/EUR. Additionally, you can use the fill handle to copy the formula to other cells, and the formula will adjust the cell references inside of the formula so that they are relative to the original formula.

Question: how to trigger laser using cameras internal signal generator?

Operator: 

To trigger a laser using the camera's internal signal generator, the user should set the camera to External Trigger mode and configure the Trigger Settings tab accordingly. The user should then connect the external trigger input on the camera head to the laser's trigger output. The user should also configure the input impedance and trigger threshold to set the trigger level to the steepest part of the input edge, typically 1/3 to 1/2 of the peak amplitude. The user should also set the camera to the desired acquisition mode (e.g. Kinetic or Integrate on Chip) and configure the settings accordingly (e.g. number of accumulations, gate delay, etc.). Finally, the user should monitor the Arm output at the back of the detector head to ensure that the system is ready to accept external triggers.

Systems such as electron multiplying charge coupled devices (EMCCDs) can be used to enable real-time point-of-care pathology for the early detection of cancers and for guiding the surgical resection of tumors. Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging can be used to differentiate between normal and malignant tissue in real-time. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping can be used to identify the node that a tumor drains into directly and the site to which tumor cells are most likely to spread first. Monoclonal antibodies coupled to fluorophores can be used to specifically detect cancer cells. Cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartate coupled to one of several fluorophores can be used to target the adhesion molecule in angiogenesis called alpha-v-beta (v3) integrin. Indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue (MB) can be used to identify bile ducts and ureters, respectively.

Question: why fiber has slow and fast axis? 

Operator: 
Fiber has slow and fast axes because of the way light travels through the fiber. Light travels more slowly along the slow axis, and more quickly along the fast axis. This is due to the refractive index of the fiber, which is higher along the slow axis and lower along the fast axis. This difference in refractive index causes the light to travel at different speeds along the two axes.

Question: why fiber has slow and fast axis? 

Operator: Fiber has slow and fast axis because of the way it is constructed. Fiber optic cables are made up of multiple layers of glass, with each layer having a different refractive index. Light traveling through the fiber is refracted by each layer, which causes it to bend and travel at different speeds depending on the direction it is traveling in. The axis of the fiber that has the slowest speed of light propagation is called the slow axis, while the axis with the highest speed of light propagation is called the fast axis.

Question: why fiber has slow and fast axis? 

Operator: 

Fiber has slow and fast axes because the orientation of the fiber affects the speed of light traveling through it. The slow axis is the direction in which light travels more slowly, while the fast axis is the direction in which light travels more quickly. This is due to the fact that the fiber is made up of a core and a cladding, and the refractive index of the core is different from the refractive index of the cladding. This difference in refractive index causes light to travel at different speeds depending on the orientation of the fiber. When installing a fiber optic sensor head, it is important to ensure that the dowel pins are inserted into the base of the sensor head prior to mating, as this will ensure that the alignment is perfectly preserved and avoid any misalignment that could cause the light to travel at different speeds.

Question: Expain time dilation to general public

Operator: Time dilation is a phenomenon where time passes more slowly for two observers when they are in relative motion with respect to each other. This means that if two people are in different places and moving relative to each other, the person who is moving faster will experience time passing more slowly than the other person. This phenomenon is caused by the effects of relativity, which states that time is affected by the speed at which an observer is moving. This means that when two observers are in motion, the passing of time is different for each of them.

This code will read the current temperature from a temperature sensor connected to pin A0, and then use that temperature to set the PWM value of pin 5. It will set the PWM value to 200 when the temperature is less than the set temperature, and 0 when the temperature is greater than the set temperature + 0.5C.

The code is written in such a way that it takes two readings of the temperature before calculating the PWM value, to ensure accuracy. It will then set the PWM value accordingly, and delay for 100ms before taking the next two readings. This allows the temperature to stabilize before the next calculation is made.

However, the source said that the government is yet to take a final decision on the issue.

The issue of minimum wage came up in the wake of the announcement of the budget for the fiscal year 2019-20.

The government had announced that it would raise the minimum wage from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 per month, in line with the recommendations of the Wage Board.

However, the government later backtracked on the decision, citing the need to ensure fiscal prudence.

We next turn to the $p$-wave channel.  The results for the
corresponding $S$-matrix are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:4}.  Here, the
$S$-matrix is also very sensitive to the particular value of $a$ for
the range of energies considered.  In particular, we observe that the
$S$-matrix is always negative for $a = -2.5$~fm and $a = -2$~fm,
whereas it is positive for $a = -1.5$~fm.  This behavior is in
contrast to the $s$-wave channel, where all three values of $a$ give
rise to a repulsive interaction.  Therefore, the $p$-wave channel is
more sensitive to the details of the short-range part of the
interaction.

We have studied the scattering of two fermions with spin $j = 1/2$
using a separable potential.  The separable potential is obtained by
fitting the scattering amplitude of the Malfliet-Tjon potential in the
$s$-wave and $p$-wave channels.  We have shown that the $s$-wave
channel is only weakly sensitive to the details of the short-range
part of the interaction, in the sense that all three values of the
range parameter $a$ considered give rise to a repulsive interaction.
In contrast, the $p$-wave channel is very sensitive to the details of
the short-range part of the interaction, in the sense that the sign of
the $S$-matrix changes with the particular value of $a$.

Question: how to replace cooling water? 

Operator: 
To replace the cooling water, first check the coolant tubes connecting the power supply unit and laser. Check the coolant connections within the laser. Refill the coolant reservoir to the proper level. Check that external cooling tubes are not accidentally clamped. Check that external tap water flow is sufficient. Check that external water temperature is low enough (10ºC below the T WATER (ºC) temperature, see Factory Settings, is recommended). For air-water cooled systems, check if the air flow to the fans in a cooling unit is obstructed (by the walls, other devices, etc.).

Question: how to replace lamp?

Operator: 

1. Ensure that the ICE450 Key Switch is OFF and all external safety interlocks are connected.
2. Disconnect the electrical cables and coolant lines.
3. Ensure that the coolant is completely removed from the Laser Head. See Draining the ICE450 on page 73 or Draining a Rack ICE450 on page 76.
4. Place the Laser Head flatly on its mounting holes.
5. Remove the lamp access cover from the Laser Head by pushing and rotating counterclockwise. Removal of the cover reveals the black plastic lamp end.
6. Keep the Laser Head flat on its mounting feet and firmly pull the black plastic lamp end outward.
7. Clean the new lamp with methanol or isopropyl alcohol.
8. Manually slide the lamp into the laser. Press with straight and even pressure to avoid breaking the flashlamp. Do not tilt the Laser Head during installation of the flashlamp. You will feel the lamp make a solid contact when completely installed. If you are unsure if the lamp is fully seated, pull the lamp back out approximately 1/2” [12 mm] and reseat it.
9. Replace the lamp access cover by pushing and rotating it clockwise.

Question: how to build interferometer for measuring distance difference with green laser ?

Operator: The basic setup of an interferometer for measuring distance difference with a green laser would include the following components:

1. A green laser source.
2. Two mirrors, placed at a known and fixed distance from each other.
3. A beam splitter to split the beam into two paths.
4. A fixed reference mirror, placed at a known distance from the beam splitter.
5. A movable mirror, placed at a known distance from the beam splitter.
6. A detector to measure the interference pattern.

To measure the distance difference between the two mirrors, the laser beam is split by the beam splitter into two paths. The two paths are then reflected off the two mirrors, and the reflected beams are recombined by the beam splitter. The recombined beam is then focused onto the detector, which measures the interference pattern created by the two beams. The interference pattern will vary depending on the difference in distance between the two mirrors, thus allowing the distance difference to be measured.

Question: how to calibrate the system?

Operator: 

To calibrate the system, firstly mount the camera onto the Shamrock spectrograph and start data acquisition. Then mount a suitable light source at the entrance slit of the spectrograph (e.g. a Mercury, or Neon discharge lamp). Power the Shamrock on and move the spectrograph to a known spectral line wavelength (e.g. Mercury 435.8 nm or the Neon 585.2 nm line). Loosen the focusing wheel clamp screw and acquire data using the camera and check the image of the light source, or alternatively, the line intensity and shape. Slowly rotate the focusing wheel until the sharpest image is achieved. It is then necessary to rotate the camera for best alignment, by loosening the screws in the flange and rotate the camera. Additionally, it is important to check the grating offset utility in the Shamrock control panel to ensure that the grating is perpendicular to the system’s horizontal axis. It is also important to check that the fibre centred at the middle of the entrance slit produces an image at the vertical middle of your detector. When complete, re-tighten the clamping screw and adjust the calibration of the system to the fitted camera.

Question: how echelle spectrometer works?

Operator: An echelle spectrometer works by splitting a light source into its component wavelengths. It does this using a diffraction grating, which is a reflective surface with a series of parallel grooves. When light strikes the grating, it is diffracted into its component wavelengths, forming an array of spectra. This array is then focused onto a detector, such as a CCD (charge-coupled device) or an array of photomultipliers. The resulting spectrum is then analyzed to determine the composition of the light source.

Operator: 

To use the internal delay generator for triggering a laser, the user should enable the Internal Trigger mode in the Setup Acquisition dialog box. The user should then enable Output A and configure the delay relative to the rising edge of the Fire pulse. The user can also configure the input impedance and trigger threshold to set the trigger level to the steepest part of the input edge. Additionally, the user should set the number of accumulations to 1, disable IOC and Gate Step, and enable External Trigger. Finally, the user should monitor the Arm output at the back of the detector head to ensure that the system is ready to accept external triggers.

Question: how to use for surgery? 


Operator: Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging can be used to help surgeons differentiate between normal and malignant tissue in real-time during surgery. This technique involves the injection of contrast agents (fluorophores) that emit light in the NIR light spectrum (650 to 900 nm). Sentinel lymph node mapping is one application where these probes are currently used. In addition, monoclonal antibodies coupled to fluorophores can be used to target specific molecules associated with cancer, such as the Her2/neu receptor or the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. NIRF imaging can also be used to identify hollow structures such as the ureter or bile duct and solid structures such as nerves. EMCCD cameras can be used to capture images of the fluorescent contrast agents and provide real-time feedback to the surgeon.

Details: [NodeWithScore(node=Node(text='Image-guided cancer surgery\nApplication Note\nCancer represents a major threat to human health, with approximately 14 million new cases being diagnosed and 7.6 million cancer deaths occurring globally\nevery year. The use of precision medicine to accurately diagnose and treat cancer is anticipated to provide the key to preventing cancer progression.\nAlthough technologies such as radiography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) have\nplayed an extremely important role in preoperative tumor diagnosis, they have no application in intraoperative tumor surgery.\nIn cancer surgery, one of the main prognostic factors for patient survival is complete tumor resection and imaging modalities that allow the precise\ndifferentiation of cancerous tissue from healthy tissue, along with the identification of vital structures, would be of great benefit in helping surgeons to\ndetermine adequate tumor margins.\nOver recent years, optical molecular imaging has emerged as a highly sensitive and specific method for the accurate detection of tumor margins. In particular,\nnear-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging has proved a powerful tool in helping surgeons differentiate between normal and malignant tissue in real-time.\nNear-infrared fluorescence (NIRF)\nNIRF imaging involves the injection of contrast agents (fluorophores) that emit light in the NIR light spectrum (650 to 900 nm), which offers distinct\nadvantages over techniques that employ visible light. In the visible light spectrum (less than 650nm), a certain amount of photons are absorbed by\nhemoglobin and in the infrared region (more than 900 nm), they are largely absorbed by lipids and water.\nLying between these two regions, however, the NIR spectrum (650 to 900nm) allows for improved penetration of photons in and out of tissue because\nabsorption, light scattering and tissue autofluorescence are relatively low, thereby offering adequate contrast. Since the human eye cannot detect\nwavelengths in the NIR region, the emitted light also has no effect on the surgical field.\nSentinel lymph node mapping\nCurrently, only two fluorophores, indocyanine green (ICG) and methylene blue (MB) have been FDA approved for use in the clinical setting. One application\nwhere these probes are currently used is a process called sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping.\nThe SLN is the node that a tumor drains into directly and the site to which tumor cells are most likely to spread first. Injection of ICG or MB around a primary\ntumor enables identification of the SLN, which can then be resected by imaging the tracer’s drainage.\nIn cases where no cancerous cells are present in the SLN, it is improbable that cancer has spread to any remaining nodes, meaning their resection can be\navoided and a patient’s chances of survival therefore improved.\nNIRF imaging of SLN offers significant safety benefits over the use of radiotracers due to the lack of ionizing radiation and SLN mapping is therefore one of\nthe most promising applications for NIRF imaging in the field of cancer surgery.\nDetection of tumor margins in image-guided resection\nVarious strategies that target the visual hallmarks of cancer (e.g. increased angiogenesis, growth and proteolytic activity) are currently used in the detection of\ncancerous cells or tissues. A main focus of cancer research has therefore been the development of probes for use in these targeted imaging strategies.\nProteases in malignant tissue, for example, can be detected using agents that are activated by enzymes. The agents are initially nonfluorescent when\ninjected, but become fluorescent after cleavage by a specific enzyme, which gives a high signal-to-background.\nAn alternative to using the detection of tumor associated proteases is the use of a monoclonal antibody coupled to a fluorophore, which can specifically detect\ncancer cells. Studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies coupled to fluorophores can target the Her2/neu receptor or the vascular endothelial growth\nfactor receptor.\nIn addition, a key adhesion molecule in angiogenesis called alpha-v-beta (v3) integrin can be targeted using cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartate coupled to one\nof several fluorophores.\nVital structure identification\nNIRF contrast agents can be used to identify both hollow structures such as the ureter or bile duct and solid structures such as nerves. For example, ICG can\nbe used to identify bile ducts because it is excreted into bile by the liver and MB can be used to identify both ureters and bile ducts because it is excreted by\nthe kidney as well as the liver.\nThe detection of nerves still requires the development of novel fluorescent probes and this currently represents a key area of cancer research.\nDetection systems\nOver the last ten years, cameras referred to as electron multiplying charge coupled devices (EMCCDs) have revolutionized imaging in the field of life\nsciences. These instruments multiply incoming light to boost signal-to -noise ratio and have enabled researchers to access a wide range of low-light imaging\napplications.\nThe latest EMCCD camera series from Andor includes the iXon Ultra 888, which has raised the bar even further, offering frame rates that are now up to three\ntimes faster and quantitative calibration of signal in units of photons or electrons, either in real-time or post-processing.\nThe iXon EMCCD camera series is renowned for outstanding reliability and product quality and its track record for minimal field failures is unparalleled.\n \n \nIn our recent intraoperative webinar entitled "The Future Of Tumor Removal - Image Guided Intraoperative Surgery",\nDr Jonathan Liu discussed how his laboratory have developed miniaturized optical-sectioning microscopes and\nmolecularly targeted contrast agents to enable real-time point-of-care pathology for the early detection of cancers\n(e.g. oral cancers) as well as for guiding the surgical resection of tumors (e.g. brain tumors). In addition, he also\ndiscussed a wide-area imaging strategy to enable the quantitative molecular phenotyping of freshly excised\ntissues during surgery. Dr. Orla Hanrahan provided technical information relating to EMCCD and sCMOS\ntechnology and their suitability for the application of intraoperative imaging.\nView our intraoperative webinar by clicking here!\nSources\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23674494●\nhttp://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/890230●\nhttp://www.thno.org/v04p1072.htm●\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3105445/●\nhttp://www.bioopticsworld.com/articles/print/volume-5/issue-05/features/nir-image-guided-surgery-progress-and-needs-for-clinical-application.html●\nhttp://www.ihe-online.com/feature-articles/image-guided-surgery-using-optical-imaging/index.html●\n ', doc_id='47a7be31-9b6d-4f11-ae16-3a0adcc8fd48', embedding=None, doc_hash='9edd7f0429694ffee07b9ba8a3621c09c6ac22457b15b78b4a2fb1a3bcf63a31', extra_info=None, node_info={'start': 0, 'end': 6768}, relationships={: '16b32111-1b9f-4a4b-a8ff-1086f5cd7089'}), score=0.8008912343083182)]

Question: how to use for surgery? 

Operator: 
Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging can be used in surgery to help surgeons differentiate between normal and malignant tissue in real-time. NIRF imaging involves the injection of contrast agents (fluorophores) that emit light in the NIR light spectrum (650 to 900 nm). This allows for improved penetration of photons in and out of tissue because absorption, light scattering and tissue autofluorescence are relatively low, thereby offering adequate contrast. Sentinel lymph node mapping is one of the most promising applications for NIRF imaging in the field of cancer surgery. Various strategies that target the visual hallmarks of cancer (e.g. increased angiogenesis, growth and proteolytic activity) are currently used in the detection of cancerous cells or tissues. Monoclonal antibodies coupled to fluorophores can target the Her2/neu receptor or the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor. Cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartate coupled to one of several fluorophores can be used to target a key adhesion molecule in angiogenesis called alpha-v-beta (v3) integrin. NIRF contrast agents can be used to identify both hollow structures such as the ureter or blood

Question: how to trigger laser from internal delay generator?

Operator: 

To trigger a laser from the internal delay generator, the user should enable the output A/B/C from the DDG and set the camera to Internal Trigger mode. The user should then configure the input impedance and trigger threshold to set the trigger level to the steepest part of the input edge, typically 1/3 to 1/2 of the peak amplitude. The user should also monitor the Arm output at the back of the detector head to ensure that the system is ready to accept external triggers. Additionally, the user should set the camera to Kinetic acquisition mode with the Number of Accumulations set to 1, and the IOC and Gate Step disabled. The external trigger will generate one gate pulse per exposure, with a gate delay applied that is the same for each exposure in the series. If the user enables the Integrate on Chip (IoC) feature, several gate pulses can be generated within an exposure, with a gate delay applied that is the same per every trigger within an exposure.
